# Ranking System
#### A simple ranking system.

#### Test:
###### 1- Admin can create teams. The team has just a name.
###### 2- Admin can invite team members by adding their name and email.
###### 3- System will send an invitation email. (it doesn't need to really send an email the generated link which is going to be emailed is important)
###### 4- Admin can assign members to the teams. Each member can appear in more than one team.
###### 5- Admin will see invited members in pending and activated state.
###### 6- Member will receive the invite email with a link (as mentioned in step 3). Clicking on the link will change the state of the member to activate.

#### Bonus steps:
###### 7- Members can see their teammates and give them a score from 1 to 5 but they cannot score themselves.
###### 8-Users can choose the leaderboard they want to see. There is one leaderboard for each different team.
###### 9- Leaderboard will show the members of a currently selected team in order of their rank.
